| Battle of Concepción   | San Antonio de Bexar        | October 28, 1835            | In the last offensive ordered by General Martin Perfecto de Cos during the Texas Revolution, Mexican soldiers surprised a Texian force camped near Mission Concepción. The Texians repulsed several attacks with what historian Alwyn Barr described as "able leadership, a strong position, and greater firepower". One Texian was injured, and Richard Andrews became the first Texian soldier to die in battle. Between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed. Historian Stephen Hardin believes that "the relative ease of the victory at Concepción instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies", which may have led to the later Texian defeat at Coleto. | T      |

| Battle of Coleto       | outside Goliad              | March 19–20, 1836           | Final battle of the Goliad Campaign. In an attempt to rendezvous with other Texian forces, the southernmost wing of Texian army brazenly departs their heavily fortified location in the midst of oppositional forces. A battle ensues with 10 Texans killed, 60 wounded and 200 Mexicans killed or wounded. After the second day of fighting, a Texian surrender is agreed upon. Approximately 342 of the captured Texans were not pardoned but were executed on March 27 in the Goliad Massacre with 20 spared and 28 escaped. Anger over Santa Anna's lack of mercy led many future Texan settlers to join the Texan Army.                                                                                  | M      |
