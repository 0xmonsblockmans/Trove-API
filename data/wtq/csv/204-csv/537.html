<td>Description</td>
<td>Absorbable biological suture material. Plain is an absorbable suture made by twisting together strands of purified <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen" title="Collagen">collagen</a> taken from <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine" title="Bovine">bovine</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine" title="Intestine">intestines</a>. The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol containing solution. Plain is absorbed by enzymatic degradation.</td>
<td>Absorbable biological suture material. Chromic is an absorbable suture made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from bovine intestines. Due to undergoing a ribbon stage chromicisation (treatment with chromic acid salts), the chromic offers roughly twice the stitch-holding time of plain catgut. The natural chromic thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol containing solution. Chromic is absorbed by enzymatic degradation. Note – catgut is no longer used in the UK for human surgery.</td>
