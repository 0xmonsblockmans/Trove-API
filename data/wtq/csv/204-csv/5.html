<td>A small purple experiment with a white lower jaw and chest, three wobbly legs, two stubby little arms and two floppy antennae with two rings on each antenna. Designed to zap a green ray from his antennas to change the size of objects. His picture appears on the wall of Jumba's lab in <i>Leroy &amp; Stitch</i>, along with several other pictures of Jumba and Dr. Hämsterviel's early accomplishments.</td>

<td>She is a white <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shih_Tzu" title="Shih Tzu">Shih Tzu</a>-like experiment with a purple bow. Designed to annoy people with her constant barking. She behaves like a typical "good dog": does tricks, licks her owner's face, fetches the morning paper, etc. Because of her appearance and behavior, 007 was adopted by Mertle and wasn't recognized as an experiment until Jumba saw her. Her episode is named "Yapper" after the nickname Lilo gave her, but she is officially "Gigi" on the experiment name list in <i>Leroy &amp; Stitch</i>. Her one true place is with Mertle, as her pet. In <i>Leroy and Stitch</i>, it is revealed that she can speak English very well. At the end of the movie, Mertle joins Lilo and Stitch's <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ohana</i> because Gigi wants to be in it with the rest of Jumba's experiments. She is voiced by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tress_MacNeille" title="Tress MacNeille">Tress MacNeille</a>.</td>

Designed to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)" title="Sterilization (microbiology)">sterilize</a>, disinfect, and clean everything in sight. However, he had a problem with doing these tasks: he threw anything away, assuming it was trash, and tried to "sterilize" anyone, assuming they were germs. 010 was upgraded to try to be less of a neat-freak. Instead, he turned into a dirt-maker, so Lilo gave him to Gantu. Gantu sent 010 to Hämsterviel, who didn't like him and sent him back. Gantu set him free, and Lilo and Stitch found him. Later, after he was upgraded, they sent him <i>back</i> to Gantu, who sent him <i>back</i> to Hämsterviel, who sent him <i>back</i> to Gantu when Woops almost broke his cover. Felix was rescued later in "Snafu." The only thing that 010 can say with both of his upgrades is dirty but with Felix he says it disgustedly while with Oscar he says it happily. Both of 010's names are a reference to the main characters of <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odd_Couple" title="The Odd Couple">The Odd Couple</a></i>.

Designed to be able to sell anything to anyone. Lilo used him to get ahead in the chocolate bar selling contest/fundraiser, but Mertle took him. When Lilo took him back, Mertle took him back again. Lilo tried to take him back once more, but found out Mertle sold him to Reuben. Slick was rescued, but Lilo had to give up the contest by giving her last chocolate bar to Gantu as a swap for Slick. His one true place is at a fundraiser, following which he began working for charity, not profit. Slick was one of the experiments Lilo turned to for the capture of Ploot, but besides selling her an umbrella that she later used against Ploot, he didn't/couldn't help.

The victims retain their normal personality while under its control, and the effect immediately wears off once Checkers is removed. Lilo first donned him, but her good intentions got many people arrested by Mertle for being "troublemakers" when they accidentally disobeyed Lilo's rules. When Lilo decided to step down, Gantu took Checkers and was in power until Stitch gathered several experiments to help overthrow him. His one true place is as a decorative crown for festivals. In the Stitch! Anime, it is shown that he will jump off his wearer if he eats really spicy foods. He is voiced by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_West" title="Billy West">Billy West</a>.</td>
