A significant portion of the ornaments were created by Arizona school children who were provided with specifications for their ornaments, including the instructions that “[o]rnaments cannot reflect a religious or political theme… Instead share your interpretation of our theme ‘Arizona’s Gift, from the Grand Canyon State.’” The ADF sent a letter to various officials associated with the 2009 tree, on the behalf of Candace Duncan, who's child wished to submit ornaments including the following phrases: \"Happy Birthday, Jesus,\" and \"Merry Christmas.\" The ADF made the argument that the child's First Amendment rights were violated by the restrictions.
