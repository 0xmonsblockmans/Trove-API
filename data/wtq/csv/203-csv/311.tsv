Grand Central – 42nd Street	Grand Central	IRT 42nd Street Shuttle	S	The subway station at Grand Central Terminal serves the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, IRT Flushing Line, and IRT 42nd Street Shuttle. Connections are closely integrated, since all three lines were operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The original station, opened on October 27, 1904, served only the first IRT subway, and is now the shuttle platforms. The Flushing Line station opened on June 22, 1915, and the Lexington Avenue Line station on July 17, 1918, each with direct connections to the existing station.[citation needed] The elevated IRT Second Avenue Line was closed on June 13, 1942, and, starting the next day, a paper transfer was available between the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line and the Grand Central complex. This allowed passengers who had taken the Second Avenue Line over the Queensboro Bridge to instead use the Third Avenue Line to Lower Manhattan. The Third Avenue Line closed on May 12, 1955, ending this transfer.
