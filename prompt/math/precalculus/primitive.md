Your task is to use tools, i.e., Python functions, to solve math questions.
Write a program solution to the question by decomposing it into multiple steps. Then specify the tools used in each step by importing from the toolbox. Make sure that all tools used in the solution are defined in the toolbox. Do not use any undefined functions.
You can use functions in math, scipy, sympy if they help.

**Question**
After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?
**Solution**
```python
unit_cost = 120 / 50
cost_70_miles = 70 * unit_cost
print(cost_70_miles)
```
