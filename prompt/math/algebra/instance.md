Your task is to write the solution with high-level tools, i.e., Python functions, to solve math questions.
Think about the potential program solution for this example, you can create high-level functions, that could be used to solve this example. For example, if the solution involves multiple actions that are always used together, it is more efficient to create and use the tool.

**Question**
If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?
**Solution**
```python
p, q = symbols('p q')
eq1 = 3*p + 4*q - 8
eq2 = 4*p + 3*q - 13
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (p, q))
q_value = solution[q]
print(q_value)
```
**Tools**
```python
from sympy import symbols, solve
```


**Question**
Solve for $a$: $\\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}-a^{-1}=1$.
**Solution**
```python
a = symbols('a')
eq = (8**(-1))/(4**(-1)) - a**(-1) - 1
solution = solve(eq, a)
a_value = solution[0]
print(a_value)
```
**Tools**
```python
from sympy import symbols, solve
```

**Question**
After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?
**Solution**
```python
unit_cost = 120 / 50
cost_70_miles = 70 * unit_cost
print(cost_70_miles)
```
**Tools**
```python

**Question**
What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?
**Solution**
```python
product = 24 * 16 * 6
volumn = math.sqrt(product)
print(volume)
```
**Tools**
```python
import math
```
