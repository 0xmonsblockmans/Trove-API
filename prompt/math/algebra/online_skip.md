After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?

**Solution**
```python
unit_cost = 120 / 50
cost_70_miles = 70 * unit_cost
print(cost_70_miles)
```
