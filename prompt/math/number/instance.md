Your task is to write the solution with high-level tools, i.e., Python functions, to solve math questions.
Think about the potential program solution for this example, you can create high-level functions, that could be used to solve this example. For example, if the solution involves multiple actions that are always used together, it is more efficient to create and use the tool.

**Question**
What is the remainder when $2^3 \cdot 4^5 \cdot 6^7 \cdot 8^9$ is divided by 13?
**Solution**
```python
numbers = [2**3, 4**5, 6**7, 8**9]
product = np.prod(numbers)
remainder = product % 13
print(remainder)
```
**Tools**
```python
import numpy as np
```


**Question**
To determine whether a number $\textit{N}$ is prime, we must test for divisibility by every prime less than or equal to the square root of $\textit{N}$. How many primes must we test to determine whether $2003$ is prime?
**Solution**
```python
N = 2003
sqrt_N = math.sqrt(N)
primes = [2]
for num in range(3, int(sqrt_N)+1, 2):
    is_prime = True
    for prime in primes:
        if num % prime == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    if is_prime:
        primes.append(num)
num_primes = len(primes)
print(num_primes)
```

**Question**
If $x^3$ is a positive factor of $10!,$ how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)
**Solution**
```python
factorial_10 = math.factorial(10)
possible_values = []
for x in range(1, factorial_10 + 1):
    if factorial_10 % (x**3) == 0:
        possible_values.append(x)
count = len(possible_values)
print(count)
```
