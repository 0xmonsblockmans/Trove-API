Your task is to use tools, i.e., Python functions, to solve math questions.
Write a program solution to the question by decomposing it into multiple steps. Then specify the tools used in each step by importing from the toolbox. Make sure that all tools used in the solution are defined in the toolbox. Do not use any undefined functions.
You can use functions in math, scipy, sympy if they help.

**Question**
What is the remainder when $2^3 \cdot 4^5 \cdot 6^7 \cdot 8^9$ is divided by 13?
**Solution**
```python
product = 2**3 * 4**5 * 6**7 * 8**9
remainder = product % 13
print(remainder)
```


**Question**
To determine whether a number $\textit{N}$ is prime, we must test for divisibility by every prime less than or equal to the square root of $\textit{N}$. How many primes must we test to determine whether $2003$ is prime?
**Solution**
```python
N = 2003
primes = [2]
for num in range(3, N, 2):
    is_prime = True
    for prime in primes:
        if num % prime == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
    if is_prime:
        primes.append(num)
num_primes = len(primes)
print(num_primes)
```
