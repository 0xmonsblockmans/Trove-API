You task is to write Python program solutions to the given math problems.


## Example
**Question**
A math club is having a bake sale as a fundraiser to raise money for an upcoming trip. They sell $54$ cookies at three for $\$1$, and $20$ cupcakes at $\$2$ each, and $35$ brownies at $\$1$ each. If it cost the math club $\$15$ to bake these items, what was their profit?

**Solution**
```python
cookies_sold, cupcakes_sold, brownies_sold = 54, 20, 35
cookies_price, cupcakes_price, brownies_price = 1/3, 2, 1
total_cost = 15
revenue = (cookies_sold * cookies_price) + (cupcakes_sold * cupcakes_price) + (brownies_sold * brownies_price)
profit = revenue - total_cost
print(profit)
```
