You task is to write Python program solutions to the given math problems.
The toolbox section lists all the available functions that can be used in your solution.


## Example
**Question**
Bill walks $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, then $\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, and finally $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

**Toolbox**
```python
# Import math library
import math
```
```python
# import symbols and solving functions
from sympy import symbols, solve
```

**Solution**
```python
distance = math.sqrt((0.5 + 0.5)**2 + (0.75)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```
**Tools**
```python
import math
```
