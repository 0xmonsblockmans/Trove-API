You task is to write Python program solutions to the given math problems.
You should also create Python functions that can be used by your solution, if you believe the function can be reused to solve other questions.


## Example
**Question**
Bill walks $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, then $\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, and finally $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

**Solution**
```python
distance = math.sqrt((0.5 + 0.5)**2 + (0.75)**2)
print(distance)
```
**Tools**
```python
import math
```
